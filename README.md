SpotMicro
=========

SpotMicro is a tiny version of the walking robotic dog Spot, 
created by Deok-Yeon Kim (https://www.instagram.com/kim.d.yeon/).

This is my personal hardware and software setup.


Arduino and Xcode
=================

Yes, you can write Arduino software in Xcode. It's done here.
And it works pretty well. I plan to improve the support,
hoping that context sensitive editing will work again,
that I can loose all the absolute path names, and that I can
find a way for the script to adapt to changeing USB port names.
